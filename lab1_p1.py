print('''Anti-Plagiarism and Anti-Collaboration Statement:

1. Plagiarism: Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. All work
submitted by students must be their own original work. This
includes code, documentation, and any other written materials.
Plagiarism is defined as the act of using someone else's work
or ideas without proper acknowledgment and presenting it as
your own. Any instance of plagiarism will result in severe
penalties, including but not limited to grade deductions,
academic probation, or even expulsion.''')

print('''2. Collaboration: Collaboration on assignments is only permitted within the guidelines explicitly specified by the instructor. It is important to distinguish between collaboration and copying. While collaboration encourages
learning and sharing ideas, copying someone else's work, in
part or in whole, is considered a violation of academic
integrity. Therefore, unless explicitly instructed otherwise,
students must complete their assignments individually. If
collaboration is allowed, it is mandatory to acknowledge the
contributors and provide appropriate citations.''')
      
print('''3. Online Resources: The use of online resources, such as forums, Q&A platforms, and code repositories, is allowed only for seeking help and clarification. However, you must not share your code or solutions on these platforms, nor should you copy code from such platforms directly into your assignments. Instead, learn from the provided explanations, examples, or discussions, and then write your own code independently.''')
      
print('''5. Academic Dishonesty: Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating on exams,
fabricating data, falsifying records, or assisting others in
any dishonest act, is strictly prohibited. Any violation of
academic integrity will be treated seriously, and appropriate
actions will be taken as per NYU Tandon policies.''')
      
print('''By submitting your work, you agree to abide by these anti-plagiarism and anti-collaboration policies. Violations of these policies will result in penalties determined by the instructor, which may include receiving a failing grade for the assignment or the course.''')

anti-collaboration policies outlined above, and I commit to
upholding the principles of academic integrity throughout this
